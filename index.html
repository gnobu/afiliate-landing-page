                <li>you've never been paid in dollars before</li>
                <li>you don't have a digital skill yet.</li>

                    In a country where about 70% are living below the poverty line, do you know that ordinary Nigerians
                    are making between $500 to $5,000 each month, just by using their phones or laptops and working with
                    international clients?
                    What's exciting is that they get to do this from the comfort of their homes (and kiss that 9-5 job
                    goodbye) or from anywhere else they choose.
                    But what is most exciting is that they get to choose how much money they earn working with these
                    international clients.
                    That's right! You get to choose how much you earn!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    They also have the freedom to use whatever mobile device they choose, as long as it has access to the
                    internet.
                    ALL THIS IS KNOWN AS FREELANCING
                </p>

                <p>
                    You too can become a part of this business model that is gradually becoming the best way to earn from
                    your knowledge and skills.
                    All you need is a high income skill like: copywriting, content writing, social media marketing, digital
                    marketing, Ui Ux designing, etc Or even graphics designing; just like Salau who got a job worth $25 per
                    hour( that's about $200 for 8hours, and $6,000 for one month).
                    Or like Anietie who has earned over $7,000 from social media marketing.

                <p>
                    Now, relax!
                    If you don't have a digital skill yet, don't worry. I'm going to teach you one.
                    A LinkedIn or/and a Facebook account, an Upwork account and an email address are the basic platforms you
                    need to get started so you can get gigs like Karen who got a contract worth $600 per month just to
                    write.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Remember, you also need the knowledge on how to position yourself to be hired by foreign clients. Again,
                    don't worry, I've got you covered.
                </p>
